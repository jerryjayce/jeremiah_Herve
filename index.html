        <p>Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other
            languages. The following pages are a useful first step to get on your way writing programs with Python!</p>
        <p>The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party modules for Python. Both Python's standard
            library and the community-contributed modules allow for endless possibilities.</p>
        <p>The community hosts conferences and meetups, collaborates on code, and much more. Python's documentation will
            help you along the way, and the mailing lists will keep you in touch.</p>
        <p>Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable,
            even for commercial use. Python's license is administered by the Python Software Foundation.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
            Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
            form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
        <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.

        <p>Okay, so we didn’t quite make our aspirational release schedule, but Rails 6 is now almost ready, so here’s
            the first release candidate! There isn’t anything remarkably new compared to the beta releases, but
            everything has been polished (in about 1000 commits!), and we believe this candidate could become the final
            release, lest we find any egregious bugs.</p>
        <p>You can read all about what’s new in Rails 6.0.0 in the first beta announcement. From Action Mailbox to
            Action Text, multiple database support, parallel testing, and Webpacker handling JavaScript by default. This
            is a massive step forward for Rails.

            Also, kudos to Sam Ruby, David Bryant Copeland, and the crew at The Pragmatic Programmers for having a beta
            of Agile Web Development with Rails 6 ready to coincide with rc1.

            Finally, we can’t wait to see everyone at a sold-out RailsConf in Minneapolis next week. It’s never been a
            better time to be programming with Rails.

            This release, and all releases leading up to Rails 6.0 final, was shepherded by release manager Rafael
            França with support by Kasper Timm Hansen.

        <p>This post contains lecture notes of “Introduction to C++” course which is taught at MIT OpenCourseWare. OCW
            is a free and open publication of material from thousands of MIT courses, covering the entire MIT
            curriculum. There’s no signup, no enrollment, and no start or end dates.

            This is introductory course to the C++ programming language. Anyone with little or no programming experience
            can equally take this course. However, someone with prior programming experience will still learn C++
            specific constructs and concepts.

            Important topics of this course are:

            Basic C++ programming constructs
            Manipulation of data types i.e. arrays, strings, and pointers using C++
            Isolate and fix common errors in C++ programs
            C++ Memory Management including proper allocation/deallocation procedures
            Object Oriented Approach using C++
            Writing C++ programs</p>
